    <h1>Pregnancy Trimesters </h1>

    <section id="first">
        <h2>First Trimester- Conception to week 12</h2>
        <p>The first trimester is a crucial phase that lasts from week 1 to week 12. It's a time of rapid development as the baby's major organs and structures begin to form.</p>
        <p>Signs and symptoms may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Missed periods</li>
            <li>Morning sickness and fatigue.</li>
            <li>Heightened sense of smell.</li>
            <li>Mood swings</li>
            <li>Cravings and food aversions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and think you may be pregnant, it is a good idea to take a pregnancy test.</p>
        <p>From conception to week 12, the pregnancy journey begins with remarkable changes. 
        Conception occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg, forming a zygote that starts dividing and traveling to the uterus, where it implants in the uterine wall.
        By week 4, the embryo has started developing its major structures, including the neural tube, which becomes the brain and spinal cord. 
        By week 8, the heart is beating, and vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs are forming. During this time, tiny buds appear that will grow into arms and legs, and facial features begin to take shape. 
        By week 12, the fetus is about 2.5 inches long and fully formed, with all major organs and body systems in place, although they continue to mature throughout the pregnancy.
